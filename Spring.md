# What are the benefits of using Spring Framework in Java EE?

Spring provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Benefits include dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and a wide range of modules for web applications, data access, and more.

**Spring Pros**

There are the following advantages of the Spring framework:

_Light Weight_: Spring is a lightweight framework because of its POJO implementation. 

_Flexible_: It provides flexible libraries/modules.

_Fast_: We can start a new Spring project in seconds by using Spring Initializr.

_Loose Coupling_: Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.

_Powerful Abstraction_: Provides a powerful abstraction to JEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA, and JTA.

_Declarative Support_: Provides declarative support for caching, validation, transaction management, and formatting.

_Configuration_: Provides a consistent way of configuring.

_Lifecycle_: Responsible for managing all your application components, through well-defined lifecycle: init(), destroy().

_Dependency Injection_: The use of dependency injection makes the easy development of JavaEE.

_Easier Testing_: The use of dependency injection makes the testing easy. The spring framework does not require a server while the EJB and Struts application requires a server.

**Spring Cons**

_Complexity_

_Parallel Mechanism_

_High Learning Curve_

_Lots of XML_
