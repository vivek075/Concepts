# What are the benefits of using Spring Framework in Java EE?

Spring provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Benefits include dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and a wide range of modules for web applications, data access, and more.

**Spring Pros**

There are the following advantages of the Spring framework:

Light Weight: Spring is a lightweight framework because of its POJO implementation. 

Flexible: It provides flexible libraries/modules.

Fast: We can start a new Spring project in seconds by using Spring Initializr.

Loose Coupling: Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.

Powerful Abstraction: Provides a powerful abstraction to JEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA, and JTA.

Declarative Support: Provides declarative support for caching, validation, transaction management, and formatting.

Configuration: Provides a consistent way of configuring.

Lifecycle: Responsible for managing all your application components, through well-defined lifecycle: init(), destroy().

Dependency Injection: The use of dependency injection makes the easy development of JavaEE.

Easier Testing: The use of dependency injection makes the testing easy. The spring framework does not require a server while the EJB and Struts application requires a server.

Secure

**Spring Cons**

Complexity

Parallel Mechanism

High Learning Curve

Lots of XML
